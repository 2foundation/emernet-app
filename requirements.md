* The Emernet App

The Emernet App is an application for accessing the global Emernet.

The Emernet is a new form of internet that is based on a decentralized, peer-to-peer, platform.

The Emernet hosts *energy forms** that users can create and push onto the Emernet, as well as observe and download from the Emernet.

Energy forms are anything from text documents, videos, music, movies.. Anything made of visual and audio energy. The platform is open-source and modular, so creative interfaces that push to the Emernet as well as access and use the Emernet are modifiable and extensible infintetely.

Emernet applications communicate through a decentralized protocol alike berty - where data is transferred from peer-to-peer through a mesh network. This means that all Emernet data is stored in user devices.

** Defining Policy with the Emernet

The power of the Emernet comes from it's use as a value network of energy forms which may create policy that the land below it has to adhere to.

For example, in the context of a village, the relevant Emernet that create the value network may be the locally created energy forms that village members observe on their Emernet applications in the area.

Some of these energy forms define community policies such as how land is to be used and by whom, the rules for the town square, or the guidelines for the local park.

The rules that have influence are the ones that are most *observed* by users of the Emernet. So if there exists a policy A and policy B created by two different community members, than the policy that will have to be followed is the one that is chosen to be observed by a majority of the village members. 

More specifically, for a policy to have power over the land below (and thus, is enforcable by the Emernet Police Force) it needs *majority vote**. The people that are included in this vote are the people that are touched by the sphere of influence of the policy - for example, it if is rules for a park, the people that use the park are counted in the pool.

If a person A spends more time in the park than person B, then their vote has more power than person B on policies about the park. One can imagine each user of the Emernet leaving behind a heat map that fades away with time. This heat map is their local influence. If one lives on the beach, they have much say over policies of the beach and nearby areas because their local influence heatmap is greates there. Therefore, when choosing policy A or B, the majority vote is the majority of energy for the area taking into consideration of the heat map factor of each person.

** User perspective

As a person travels from town to town the energy forms of policy above may change. This is because the energy forms of policy have a local sphere of influence - for example, a rule may be for the entire land mass of north america (e.g. the ability to travel freely) or for one village (e.g. help in the community garden if you are a resident**. The policies that they have to adhere to refresh as their location changes and easily display.
